      <p class="headline">The Key Bridge collapse had a nationwide ripple effect: West Coast workers received PORT Act funds</p>

      <p class="byline">By Matt Cohen</p>

      <p>[<a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EcCoY2pZKO-G-Yd-NvHABPf2Bnpa56uVvP_vtBlN9ec/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here for link to editable google doc</a>]</p>

      <p><strong>BALTIMORE —</strong> Officials and foundations in Maryland quickly organized several pots of grant funding for workers who lost their jobs as a result of the Key Bridge Collapse on March 26, 2024. The loss of the Interstate 695 thoroughfare and blockage of the Port of Baltimore would have a significant impact on Baltimore City and County.</p>

<p>Now, just over a year later, data shows the bridge’s ripple on the work force quite literally extended coast-to-coast as well as locally hitting Anne Arundel County hard too.</p>

<p>Now, just over a year later, experts have directly tied the unemployment claims to the bridge — whether it be the short term spike of the Port of Baltimore closure or the long term impact at rush hour.</p> 

<p>“It’s going to be tough to maintain that employment which is in the longer term sense of things, it’s just going to lead to so many downstream impacts of people’s ability to have really good, long-term, well-paying jobs, live in nice neighborhoods, send their kids to nice schools,” Cheryl Knott, assistant director of the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance, said.</p> 

<p>The Maryland Port Administration estimates the port’s activity generates about 51,000 jobs — about 20,000 of which are directly working at the Port. The MPA also estimates another 220,310 jobs that are at least related to Port activity. And that’s just within Maryland.</p> 

<p>Included in the PORT Act — Gov. Wes Moore’s relief effort which provided more than $30 million worth of grants — Maryland also set up the Worker Support Fund which was funding targeted at those who had lost income entirely in relation to the port closure. Approved applicants could receive weekly $430 payments. The funding was separate from traditional unemployment insurance. The program stopped taking applications on June 28, 2024.</p>

<p>Data received from the Maryland Department of Labor via a public records request showed 3,363 approved applicants. Maryland residents made up 96.9% of the applicants and 21122, the zip code for Pasadena in Anne Arundel County, had the third most applicants of any zip code behind 21222 (Dundalk) and 21206 (Baltimore). </p>

<p>The next largest set of claimants came with home zip codes in nearby states Pennsylvania (63), Delaware (15) and Virginia (15). There were also a few workers in much further away states like Washington, Florida, Georgia and Minnesota.</p> 

<p>“This can be for a range of reasons, such as if a recipient works in trucking at the port but has a home base in another area, lives in temporary housing in Maryland but has a mailing address in another area, or has moved out of state,” a Department of Labor spokesperson said in an email of the payments to distant zip codes. “All recipients were required to prove eligibility.”</p>

<p>Those who received Worker Support Program money could also receive standard unemployment insurance benefits. And those claims spiked to their highest level of 2024 the week of the bridge collapse. Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County accounted for 19 of the top 20 zip codes with the most unemployment insurance claims between April 2024 and February 2025. In March 2024, Dundalk zip code 21222 had the most claims of any Maryland zip code.</p>

<p>Baltimore County data shows no industry was hit harder than transportation and warehousing — which are directly connected to the port. But unemployment levels within the industry have generally returned to pre-collapse numbers.</p> 

<p>“I total Baltimore County in this time period had 562 port-related claims,” Austin Wenck, Baltimore County manager of data analytics, said of unemployment claims between March 26 and May 7, 2024. “Eighty one percent of these were related to transportation or material moving occupations.”</p>

<p>The Baltimore Community Foundation — a fundraising organization that, according to its website, works with charity and philanthropy groups to support Baltimore-area residents — raised at least $16 million in relief funding.</p>

<p>The money that was raised from major donors like the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens which each gave more than $1 million as well as donations from more than 300 individual people was used largely to give direct payments to people who lost income. BCF gave more than $4 million to the CASH Campaign of Maryland which then gave money to individual people. The CASH Campaign declined an interview for this story. </p>

<p>“When you think about all of the individuals and the people who are reliant on the port or  the economic activities surrounding the port for business, you quickly get a sense of the type of economic impact that that has,” Becky Eisen, communications director for the BCF, said. “Even though the port is now reopened, there has been a reverberation of impact in these communities.”</p>

<p>Eisen said there has been a shift in utilizing the funds toward small businesses. She said BCF plans to announce its next steps — including upcoming payments to local impacted small businesses — in late April. </p>

<p>What’s next in Maryland could fall on the bridge reconstruction. Knott said there is a correlation between commute times and unemployment. Census data from 2022 shows the second largest zip code of workers traveling to work at and around the port are coming from Pasadena — on the other side of the bridge.</p> 

<p>The commute could mean some workers moving closer to work, Knott suggested. </p>

<p>Or, it could mean more quit their jobs entirely. </p>
